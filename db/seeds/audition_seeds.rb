Her generosity of spirit is put to the test when she is falsely accused of harming Q.
WOULD ALSO PLAY Q ON EVERY OTHER PERFORMANCE.\n\n

Q\n\n
Female, mid 20’s, Latinx, East Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern or Multiracial. She has newly arrived in Country X, where her fiancé has moved to take advantage of a good business opportunity.

She is curious, intellectual and though wide-eyed, she falls short of being naive.
WOULD ALSO PLAY B ON EVERY OTHER PERFORMANCE.\n\n

F\n\n

WOULD ALSO PLAY F ON EVERY OTHER PERFORMANCE.\n\n

Male, 40’s, Latinx, East Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern or Multiracial. J is a Country Y citizen who is a “Security Liaison” in Country X. He is R’s friend and confidante.

D\n\n
(also to play S and Gecko)
Male, 40’s, Latinx, East Asian, Native American or Multiracial. D is the Head Doctor at the hospital where B works. He has all the power and arrogance his position implies, but at heart he is a grounded, kind and humane person. WOULD ALSO PLAY J ON EVERY OTHER PERFORMANCE.\n\n
